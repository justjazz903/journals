I have come and realize that smoking and porn addiction are closely intertwined. If I want to get rid of them, I have to get rid both of them at the same time. But... how? There are so many triggers in my life right now. So many anxiety. First and the biggest, my job. Then my girlfriend, my family, my future plan, my personal development. Okay, no need to list them all, There will always be new shit coming the way. Smoking and watching porn used to be my ways of dealing with these anxiety. If I wish to quit smoking and porn, what do I do to replace them. The thing to replace those must be realistic. It must be relaxing, some kind of entertainment, not hard to acquire under most of circumstances. I guess this kind of activity is hard to find. 

1. Listening to music
2. Meditating
3. Play some toy
4. Go for a walk
5. Journaling

Seems none of the above has the intensity as smoking or watching porn. That is understandable, since too much pleasure is not healthy. So far I think journaling is the most effective. Let's try that first.
