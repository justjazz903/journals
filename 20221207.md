Let's first review what happened these past months.
I changed my job, I'm at Huawei now.
I'm still smoking.
I'm still addicted to porn, but not as severe.
I'm still staying up late.
I haven't worked out for a week.

These are all old habitates. I have been suffering from them. The fact that I'm still suffering from them makes me angry, shameful and despair. Will I ever be able to quit them? Will I ever be healthy? Will I ever be able to control myself?
Which is why I stopped journaling for the past months. Because all I'm doing is writing how badly I wanted to kill those bad habits and then all I did is nothing. I broke the promises I made to myself everyday. In the end, I stop making promises since I can not keep them. I am weak and I ran.
But I still want to quit. I'm miserable because of these toxic poison. I am afraid that I might just die if I don't change. Yet I fear that I might never be able to overcome this.
Self-discinpline, Self-controll. Knowing smoking kills does not stop me from doing it. Feeling smoking kills does not stop me from doing so. How powerful is that?
They say it's easier to replace a bad habit with a good habit. But I think it's ridiculous. Bad habits are your escape. One need to do nothing to keep a bad habit. Because bad habits make me feel good, at least temporarily. Developing a good habit takes time and energy, it is hard.
People pay great efforts to form a good habit. People pay great efforts to kill a bad habbit. To say replacing a bad habbit with a good habit is saying that double the efforts. That is, if not entirely but very unlikely.
I have tried to quit smoking for years and without success. How is it possible for me to quit smoking and keep going to the gym at the same time? Going to the gym is hard and comsuming, it is not as easy and comfortable as smoking. If anything, it just makes quiting harder.
So far, the only useful experience I have is to not think about them. If you keep thinking about the idea of you can not smoke, what you are doing is just think about smoking and thinking about smoking does not make the addiction go away.
Forgetting is the true death. Only by forgetting to smoke, to masturbate, to stay up late can you truly stop.
Think about something else. Don't let it occupied your mind.
